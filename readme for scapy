🛡️ README – Network Packet Sniffer using Scapy (Python)
📌 Overview

This project is a network packet sniffer built using the Scapy library in Python.
It captures live network traffic and extracts detailed information such as:

Source & Destination IP

Protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP…)

TTL, Flags, Fragment Offset

MAC Addresses

TCP/UDP Ports

Sequence & Acknowledgment Numbers

Payload Data

Timestamp

This tool is designed for learning, cybersecurity research, and traffic analysis.

🚀 Features

✔ Captures real-time packets
✔ Extracts IP header details
✔ Identifies TCP, UDP, and ICMP packets
✔ Shows Ethernet (MAC) addresses
✔ Displays TCP flags, ports, sequence numbers
✔ Shows packet payload
✔ Lightweight and easy to use
✔ Based on Scapy — no external dependencies
